# Issues
## 1. Problems
### 1.1 Need Communication between agents
E.g in Level: Happyya.lvl
one goal is blocked by another agent. So the low level planner will not be able to find a solution.
Idea --> merge the two group into one meta_agent.

### 1.2 Complex level - Agent needs go through a small gate
E.g in Level: MAthomasAppartment_redblue.lvl
Even single agent, can't get the way. Need find some more efficient low level solver to find the path.
Idea --> modify the huristic function to make it more efficient.

## 2. Direction of novity implementation 
Do some detection at the very beginning. Then choose the B parameter to the MA-CBS
### 2.1 CBS($\infty$) outperform in Much Open Space level - 
E.g in Level: Flower.lvl, Flower2.lvl

### 2.2 CBS(1) outperform in corridor level, which is like an A*
E.g in Level: MAsimple2, MAsimple3, MAsimple4, PlanB

### 2.3 About the low level space definition - DONE
if there is more than one agent in the low level, then the low level can ignore the time when compare
which will outperform. Because it will make the space smaller.
